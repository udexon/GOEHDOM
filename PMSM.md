## Phos Multitiered Stack Machine

http://phos.epizy.com/pmsm/

As tutorials on Forth programming language have been widely available, we will not reiterate here. Rather, we shall focus on novel implementations of Phos Multitiered Stack Machine (PMSM).

We demonstrate [Phos Multitiered Stack Machine (PMSM)](http://phos.epizy.com/pmsm/) as a simple JavaScript+PHP web page.

Phos RPN commands can be entered via the Developer Console as a space delimited string by calling function `F()`, e.g.

```
F("1 a tn: a a b tnn:")
```
