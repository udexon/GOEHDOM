### Program Repair using JVM

In Ghanbari (2018), a byte code level automatic program repair (APR) system was created for Java virtual machine (JVM) and was able to produce geniune patches for 43 bugs in Defects4J data set, outperforming state-of-the-art APR.

JVM is essentially a stack machine. As such, techniques used in Ghanbari and related works can be readily ported to Phos HGM.

Abstract Automated Program Repair (APR) is one of the most recent advances in automated
debugging, and can directly fix buggy programs with minimal human intervention. Although
various advanced APR techniques (including search-based or semantic-based ones) have …
