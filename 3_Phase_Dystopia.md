### Three Phases towards a Robotic Dystopia: A Marxist Interpretation of Technological Singularity and Collective Intelligence

We have just entered the first decade of zero advantage from population growth, marked by the rise of Huawei and DJI, world largest makers of Android mobile devices and network equipment, and commercial unmanned aerial vehicles. So even academics have not time to conceive theories on the age of diminishing population returns. 

Prior to the age of Huawei and DJI, population growth is essential to sustain military strength and economic development. 

Before the rise of China, Japan was the role model for developing countries. However, it has become a victim of its own success as America basically pulled the plug to stop Japan from overtaking it. China is facing such pre-emptive strike from America now. We believe China has a much larger population and people with better mindset to withstand similar attacks.

While US-China trade tension may continue to occupy headlines for the years to come, we would like to draw the following trends which we believe would eventually lead to technological singularity:

- Urbanization drives population away from rural areas. Mines and farms and fishery becomes completely robotics. 

- More and more labourious jobs in cities will be taken over by robots -- cleaners, police, waiters etc. 

- Developing countries will be depopulated, by slow death, low birth, war or planned diseases. 

- Only countries with absolute military autonomy like China, India, Europe and America will survive. 

- Japan may become inhabitable due to natural or indsutrial disasters like that of Fukushima. At the same time, Chinese migration may turn Japan into a vassal state of China. 

- Populous cities first. 

- Bourgeois control robots. Proletariat live by manual labor. Bourgeois kill proletariat by war or controlled genocide, to get land, mines, resources on land and sea. 

- Finally, proletariat human are extinguished. Then bourgeois human and robot class war begin , after they invent human robot religions, for ease of motivating and mobilization.
