### Bootstrapping Machine Intelligence

We propose a bootstrap mechanism for machine intelligence, where fundamental data structures and operations are represented in reverse Polish notation and evaluated by a virtual machine, and its results in turn assessed by a human programmer. 

By "machine intelligence", we refer to the  low level aspects of artificial intelligence such as arithmetic and logical operations, image processing, chess playing etc., specifically the algorithms that have been implemented as code of a programming language. We reserve the term "artificial intelligence" to a more general category of computations, including those theories which have yet to be implemented as computer program.

One of the novelties of our solution is its portability, which enables it, in theory, to be implemented in any known host programming language. We have tested it on the following programming languages:

- C, C++, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Rust, Haskell, Forth, LISP, Go

Based on the sample code which we have made available, we believe it will only take a competent student taking up introductory programming courses as little as one week to port our solution, called Phos Multitiered Stack Machine, to a programming language of his (her) choice. 

The portability of PMSM is crucial to the viability of bootstrapping machine intelligence, as it enables us to access code written in practically any known programming language, including assembly language of most microprocessors, using one universal script, ie. Reverse Polish Notation, and examine their relationships. 

The scope of code to be examined could range from simple PHP associative array to 3D multiplayer games.

#### Main Contribution

As we are able to represent all known code in RPN, we may attempt to build a hierarchy of code, starting from the most primitive assignment operation to the most complex numerical functions. 
We will be able to construct functions that compose functions using primitive functions, based on the homoiconic properties of RPN.

#### Human level artificial intelligence is type III search

Our conjecture: Human level artificial intelligence is type III search.

- Type I search: simple look up.
- Type II search: predefined functions, map, inverse kinematics, chess.
- Type III search: homoiconic composite functions

Now it is possible to compare and analyze function composition in Phos vs. other programming languages. Previously not possible. This is one of the most crucial benefits of Phos.
