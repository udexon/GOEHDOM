### Metaprogramming Questions

[Metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)：

- is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. It means that a program can be designed to read, generate, analyze or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.

Homoiconicity and metaprogramming are two fields in computer programming that lack ... because of non existence of suitable notations and data structures for  representation and analysis. 

Consider the following seemingly trivial example:

Program A: `echo 1;`

Program B: `echo 2;`

Programs A and B are both PHP programs or equivalent.

Consider the following `sed` command:

Program C: `sed -i 's/old-text/new-text/g' input.txt`

Now, a human programmer would easily understand that Program C can be used to transform Program A to Program B by subsituting the parameters:

Program C1: `sed -i 's/1/2/g' prog_a.php`

But, as a human programmer, he (she) may ask:

- Why 1 and 2? 

- What about the following?

Program D: `echo $argv[1];` 

- Or, Program E:

```
if (condition_1) echo 1;
else echo 2
```

A human programmer may have "reasons" or "motivations" to choose any of the above.

Based on this simple example, we may ask the questions above. These questions concerning metaprogramming are easily understood. However, there has been no single comprehensive programming language that can be used to address these questions. 

Easy to understand, lots of work to find solutions. 

问题浅显易懂， 答案高深莫测。 新弗式是解答的工具。 

其中一个最基本的问题， 就是如何用程序语言代表问题， 然后分析问题， 自动或半自动找出或运算出解方？ 新弗式皆可胜任。

Having established the need for metaprogramming questions, we now consider how a ["homoiconic notation"](https://github.com/udexon/Shumage/blob/master/OEHDOM_eng.md) may offer solutions.

Question answering is a niche area in AI. Not sure the programming languages used by others can address metaprogramming issues?

It is easy for human beings to conceive questions. It is non trivial for programmers to find programming languages or data structures to represent questions. 

Implement prolog in forth? 

Fundamentally,  we may need to simulate the motivations of a programmer -- why is he writing a program? To survive, of course. Then we may need to simulate food, energy and defense, how he develop sense of survival since birth. 

Goal based problems. Map. Path finding. Reverse kinematics etc. Generalized to all problems, including programming? Use Phos to prove. 

Theories or models similar to this might have been proposed elsewhere, however, our novelty is Phos, a homoiconic multi level programming language that can used to prove and implement such model step by step. 

Goal oriented homoiconic model for artificial intelligence

Most programming assignments (academic or commercial) have limited set of goals. The  Programmer's task is to find sets of combination of functions to map input to output, consistent with graph theory.

Or just print for debug purposes? 

GitHub patch code is not full fledged programmable script. Phos is. 

Phos command can be embedded as comments in any existing file or additional files in existing directory or a new subdirectory. Call it Delta code.

Delta code is the basis of fees pay out. Conflict with free software licenses? Depends. Discuss several scenario.

Use Android project to illustrate. Gradle is based on groovy, a JVM derived Language. 



#### Universal Homoiconicity

Universal: across programming languages.

Before human or program finds an answer, he or it creates questions first. Questions can be hierarchical, including metaprogramming questions like above. Phos provide the framework to construct the hierarchy of questions and search for answers, low level to high level data structure, code, across all programming languages. 

### Roadmap towards Technological Singularity and Individual Programmer's Actions

#### Benefits of Learning Phos

Programmers who learn Phos will learn about most fundamental concepts in programming and mathematics 

Programmers would code changes in existing programming languages. No metaprogramming. No reuse. No automation. Phos enables metaprogramming and automation, although need time to build up. But they are accumulative. 

#### Control Experiment

With or without GOEHDOM, what would happen to the world? What would the programmers do as usual? Learning curve for Phos?


#### Learning Curve for Learning Phos

Number of programmers picking up GOEHDOM in 1, 2, 5 year's?

It is possible that human programmers write enough code to achieve technological singularity without self modifying homoiconic code? 

Lack of new ideas in recent years is evidence to the above?

Derivative Homoiconicity? Which programming language homoiconicity is not derivative? Use Phos to analyze this issue. Let others do it. Beyond scope for now. Good to define question.

By definition, we do not know how much homoiconic code will be needed to achieve human level artificial intelligence. However, through trials, when we have 100 or 1000 Phos code example, we may begin to find a pattern, just like any scientific experiment. 




#### Examples for GOEHDOM Projects

Need to find one or more open source war games to work on as examples?

https://github.com/topics/game

Or start with any other projects, e.g. DJ mix app, since GOEHDOM should connect them together, like human programmers work together, although their programs are written in incompatible programming languages, human programmers are the translators of ideas between game or software projects. Hence GOEHDOM is equivalent to human programmers. GOEHDOM and human programmers have same input and output, ie. program source code. 


Examples of Phos metaprogramming code and automation. Trivial example 1+ 2 = 3, write in Phos. 

XRPN Phos should be flexible enough to represent and process any fundamental or composite structures, tests, metaprogramming code, etc, including this sentence itself, and create any new Programming Language or structures in new Programming Languages.

Explain relationship of XRPN to LISP, HOL Light etc. XRPN acts as glue amongst different programming languages and their libraries, each has strengths in different areas? HOL Light for logic and math, C++ for ... , PHP for ...

The above is perhaps the most important missing pieces in constructing human level artificial intelligence? Because human knowledge and thoughts are not restricted to one programming language? Or need one universal programming language to code everything from simple logic to complicated questions? 

At every paragraph, throughout article, always think, how does current paragraph relate to subject of article? ie. How to achieve AI, current paragraph: fundamental mathematics with XRPN.

Explain differences of RPN, XRPN. 

War games repositories are written in many different programming languages. All can be coded in Phos. Changes are well documented. No need to go back in time, although possible. Once Phos function written, can go back in time to process them, to find patterns. 


GOEHDOM: A practical and measurable roadmap towards human level artificial intelligence

Before human or program finds an answer, he or it creates questions first. Questions can be hierarchical, including metaprogramming questions like above. Phos provide the framework to construct the hierarchy of questions and search for answers, low level to high level data structure, code, across all programming languages. 


#### Automation on free software repositories exceeds human effort.

:: Repeat emphasize the above

Emphasize Phos OEHDOM can be implemented in any host programming language. Need to differentiate Phos and OEHDOM?

Differentiate Phos, OEHDOM, GOEHDOM?? 

In the brief presentation above, we introduced Phos, OEHDOM, GOEHDOM.

Phos is name given to XRPN ...

OEHDOM is ....

GOEHDOM is ....

What can programmers do about them?

All war games development go through phases. Build up community, increase coders, mature, mutate or coders move on. Phos can maximize portability. Then build up metaprogramming questions and answers database, until it becomes self complete. ?? 

Present realities; What can be done? What are the goals, when to achieve? 





在万能代码的基础上， 我们可以开发出一个 “无终结开放型文件模式”。 至今为止， 所有的计算机文件模式， 都是有始有终的。所谓  “无终结开放型文件模式”， 就是在原有的目录结构和文件里， 加入新弗式的指令， 可以代表程序员对现有文件的改动。

我们改动的文件， 主要是编程项目里调适及源码文件。 许多编程项目的文件， 其繁冗复杂程度， 例如安卓应用项目， 编程项目的文件， 早已发展到超越人手调置的限度。新的工具和程序语言被开发来处理现有的项目文件， 把总体结构和文件简化了吗？ 还是更加繁复？我们要 如何一劳永逸的解决这个问题？

新弗式差别码的原理， 来自程序员编辑源码文件的动作， 例如， 删、 插入、 移动、 抄、 粘帖等。 这些动作的指令， 还存在于历史悠久的 sed 及 vi 等工具。 GitHub patch file 也同属一类。 然而， 这些指令， 不能算得上是全面的程序语言。 不过， 它们和程序语言的差别， 其实只是一桥之隔。引用这个成语， 是暗喻图论祖师爷欧拉的七桥问题。 新弗式就可以统合文件编辑指令和全面程序语言。 

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8279602/what-is-a-patch-in-git-version-control

我们分析一个相对复杂， 实在的项目， 来讲解新弗式的运用原理：

Vinyl Cast 和 Rhythm Game 是两个基于 Google Oboe ( 谷歌  双簧管  )  的安卓应用项目。  双簧管 是 安卓平台上的一个 C++ 高效能音频处理库， Vinyl Cast 原本的作用， 是在安卓仪器上录制胶盘的音乐， 然后以 http 协定， 转播到浏览器上。 Rhythm Game 是一个混合拍打和音乐的示范应用。  理论上， 我们可以改良以上的项目， 制作一个 DJ 混音的应用， 并加入 http 转播功能， 形成一种新式的 “接龙混音” 应用。

改动原有源码文件和调置文件的过程， 完全是程序员手动操作， 即使用文本编辑器， 改动原文件的字节。 

Metaprogramming 元编程， 是使用第三方工具或语言， 间接的对原始文件改动。

人们在讨论技术问题和方法时， 会牵涉到高阶或低阶的概念和实际操作。  程序员改动源码文件就是一个低阶的实际操作。 元编程， 是高阶的实际操作。

一般的程序开发， 程序员很少会直接使用元编程。 

新弗式， 可以将元编程普及到所有已知的程序语言， 让程序员使用高阶的元编程， 对源码进行改动。

https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%83%E7%BC%96%E7%A8%8B

如维基百科 “元编程” 所述， 一般人对元编程的认识只局限于单一程序语言范围内应用， 而新弗式的跨语言元编程， 是一个突破性的新发明。 

新弗式， 可以对任何已知的程序语言进行元编程。 

元编程， 到底是什么高深莫测高大上的玩意儿？ 还是一种深入浅出、 返璞归真、 化整为零的玩意儿？
