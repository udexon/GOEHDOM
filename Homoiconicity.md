#### Homoiconic Transformation

[Dijkstra's Shunting Yard Algorithm (DSYA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) might be regarded as the common ancestor of subsequent programming languages. It was central to the design of ALGOL, which influenced all other modern programming languages.

Although the Forth programming language has been implemented in many host Programming Languages in the past, I believe I was the first to coin the term ***Inverse Shunting Yard Algorithm (ISYA)*** as a generalization of *translating reverse Polish notation into a host (high level, "third generation") programming language,* which is effectively the inverse of Dijkstra's now legendary Shunting Yard Algorithm (DSYA). In summary, the steps include parsing a list of tokens in the Reverse Polish Notation, pushing non-function tokens on to the stack, and executing a function upon reading a function token.

We would like to introduce the term "homoiconic transformation" to refer to process of transforming non-homoiconic code into homoiconic form, involving the use DYSA and ISYA. 

The module that implements homoiconic transformation is called "Phos Multitiered Stack Machine":

:: put link at critical locations for details and coding examples

One of the novelties of our solution is its portability, which enables it, in theory, to be implemented in any known host programming language. We have tested it on the following programming languages: 

:: add links

- C, C++, Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Rust, Haskell, Forth, LISP, Go

Based on the sample code which we have made available, we believe it will only take a competent student taking up introductory programming courses as little as one week to port our solution, called Phos Multitiered Stack Machine, to a programming language of his (her) choice. 


#### Relationship from fundamental graph operations in PMSM to GS3 

The portability of PMSM is crucial to the viability of bootstrapping machine intelligence, as it enables us to access code written in practically any known programming language, including assembly language of most microprocessors, using one universal script, ie. Reverse Polish Notation, and examine their relationships. 

As we are able to represent all known code in RPN, we may attempt to build a hierarchy of code, starting from the most primitive assignment operation to the most complex numerical functions. 
We will be able to construct functions that compose functions using primitive functions, based on the homoiconic properties of RPN.

An RPN operator is homoiconic as it can become an operand of another RPN operator.

While there has been no ?? mathematical model on homoiconic transformation, HT intrinsically by definition can bootstrap its own mathematical model. Use homoiconic code to build mathematical model to analyze homoiconic code.

The scope of code to be examined could range from simple PHP associative array to 3D multiplayer games.

Homoiconic transformation: transform non homoiconic code into homoiconic form. 

:: Focus on this as theoretical basis of code transformation to convince readers. 

Theoretical issues can be addressed using homoiconic code build up itself!!

Homoiconic transformation = Shunting Yard Algorithm + Inverse

#### Main Contribution

As we are able to represent all known code in RPN, we may attempt to build a hierarchy of code, starting from the most primitive assignment operation to the most complex numerical functions. 
We will be able to construct functions that compose functions using primitive functions, based on the homoiconic properties of RPN.

#### Human level artificial intelligence is type III graph search (GS3)

Homoiconic Graph Search as Model of Human Level Artificial Intelligence

(HGS)

Homoiconic Graph Machine HGM??

:: Emphasize word "graph"

Our conjecture: Human level artificial intelligence is type III search.

Type I search: simple look up.

Type II search: predefined functions, map, inverse kinematics, chess.

Type III search: homoiconic composite functions

Now it is possible to compare and analyze function composition in Phos vs. other programming languages. Previously not possible. This is one of the most crucial benefits of Phos.

Discuss simple tree to type III search.

[Phos multitiered stack machine](http://5gl.epizy.com/nsm/Phos.html) demonstrates the viability of implementing a shell to execute Phos commands within any known host programming language.

By definition, we do not know how much homoiconic code will be needed to achieve human level artificial intelligence. However, through trials, when we have 100 or 1000 Phos code example, we may begin to find a pattern, just like any scientific experiment. 

Time from now to Technological singularity, time to build 100k Phos function for self question answering?

Concepts need to be built based on code. eg. pointers. Same with stack machine.

#### Learning Curve

#### Benefits of Learning Phos

:: Needs to elaborate as it is a new language. Use this as tutorial and marketing piece.

One may wonder what the benefits of learning Phos are, compared to the at least a dozen of well publicized and well documented new programming languages, supported by huge corporations? 

Graph theory, fundamental of programming, mathematics, unification of programming and mathematics.

3 most important reasons first, others later:

- fundamental of graph and stack machine programming
- Forth can provide the above, but no ecosystem to learn, hence Phos let programmers to create own ecosystem compatible with existing habits, from JavaScript to Android NDK. Cite examples.
- to understand the concepts and motivations proposed in this project.
Phos does not conflict with other ecosystems, but is the glue to integrate all ecosystems.

:: Must write to motivate others as pioneers. This is the reality I must face. Then only will readers trust me.

Say I will be happy to recruit 5 collaborators.
