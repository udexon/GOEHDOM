### Three Phases towards a Robotic Dystopia: A Marxist Interpretation of Technological Singularity and Collective Intelligence

We have just entered the first decade of zero advantage from population growth, marked by the rise of Huawei and DJI, world largest makers of Android mobile devices and network equipment, and commercial unmanned aerial vehicles.

Urbanization drives population away from rural areas. Mines and farms and fishery becomes completely robotics. Police too. 

Populous cities first. Depopulate developing countries, by slow death low birth, or war. China India Europe America. Japan inhabitable due to disasters and Chinese migration.

Finally, proletariat human are extinguished. Then bourgeois human and robot class war begin , after they invent human robot religions, for ease of motivating and mobilization.
