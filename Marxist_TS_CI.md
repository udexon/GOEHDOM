### A Marxist Interpretation of Technological Singularity and Collective Intelligence

While Marxist class struggle has fallen out of fashion in the West, perhaps due to successfully social engineering or media manipulation, it is now regaining audience in the world's stage due to China's emergence. Class struggle may better explains the transition of society as FHLAI gains prominence. 

We employ Marxist class struggle to interpret technological singularity, by considering the possibility of "collective intelligence" made of human and machine intelligence, instead of man vs. machine as with conventional interpretation of technological singularity.

We outline our predictions in chronological order.


#### Muslims as Primary Victims of Technological Singularity

While we do not advocate genocide on any specific group of people, we believe it is beneficial to outline the threats, so that the target group can be aware and prepare against them.

2. New type of class struggle

Current religious factions will be at war. 

White Christians, 

Islam,

Coloured Chinese plus Indian plus coloured Christians. 

Muslims have no technology advantage. Will be sacrificed. 20 years genocide. Suppprt murtads. Chinese and Christian divide the spoils. New forms of liberal Muslims?


#### New Type of Class Struggle

The most immediate and likely TS event would be: 

TS1: Can MPAI turn against human inhabitants in space colonies?

That would be at least 100 years away from now.

TS2: Single Robocop goes rogue and harm human beings.

TS3: Mining robots in isolated mining colonies on Earth go rogue.

TS4: Number of robotic mining or farming colonies and Robocop grows to critical point. Human conspirators collaborate with robots for coup d'etat.

Use Marxist class struggle to predict the above. Human form collective intelligence with machine to form new class and new type of class struggle.

We have already passed the techical threshold for the above to happen. What are needed are just time and number of robots. May happen in 50 years.

World war may accelerate the above as human loss of lives may necessitate robot deployment for reconstruction. 


Defending Humanity with Good Robots 

Phos HGM will make robot tech accessible to all, distributed defense, like rights to carry guns in USA?

HGM completes TS already? Predicts machine supremacy without composition ability? Just need human hard code? 

1. Man vs. machine is conventional TS model.

HGM and current economic output of MCAI predict machine intelligence need human to form HGCI, not man vs. machine.

:: Disproving Technological Singularity using Homoiconic Graph Theory

:: Disproving Technological Singularity using Homoiconic Graph Collective Intelligence

Technological singularity (TS) has become a fashionable topic of debate concerning artificial intelligence  for experts as well as non experts in recent years.

We propose an alternative view to disprove technological singularity, which at the same time provides a more relevant and realistic approach to applications of artificial intelligence in the real world. 

While TS has been promoted wildly, rarely has its theoretical basis been examined, to prove it or otherwise. 

We propose that proponents of TS somehow assume a computer system can be operated in isolation from human support, and yet, overwhelms human beings militarily. 

We may call the alternative model to TS collective intelligence (CI), a concept that has many parallels in Asian cultures. While CI is not new, modeling CI using HGT is, hence Homoiconic Graph Collective Intelligence (HGCI).

HGCI postulates that an individual human being acquires knowledge from external sources much like a computer program calling external function libraries. Formally, a computer program may undergo homoiconic transformation to become a homoiconic graph. Homoiconic graph can be used to model the human mind as well as a computer program. 

Although programmers appear to be adopting the same manner in managing function libraries since the Fortran era of 1950s, we believe HGT is a novel attempt that can model this behavior satisfactorily, as well as modeling mechanisms of how human manages knowledge in general. 

To illustrate the parallels in managing function libraries and human knowledge, consider the following:

A. Programmers spend countless hours writing library functions. The author of an end user program simply calls these library functions without having to understand the intricacies of developing them.

B. One out of millions of human beings becomes a scientist who discovers breakthrough theories or experiments once or several times in his whole life, using resources of many people and organizations, knowledge of decades or centuries. 

C. In terms of absolute economic output, what can be classified as "artificial intelligence" may not have exceeded 0.1% today. It may not exceed 1% in 10 year's time. Strictly, advocates of technological singularity should quantify number of computer systems that can be qualified as adversarial human level artificial intelligence (AHLAI), in order to measure the timeline in which AHLAI overtakes human beings. However, such figures do not seem to exist.

To address these concerns, we propose Friendly Human Level Artificial Intelligence (FHLAI) based on HGCI. 



In order to construct a comprehensive theory for the near future, say 50 years, of mankind, we also consider outer space exploration and simulation, as they provide realistic and practical environments for development of FHLAI and HGCI.

metaprogramming artificial intelligence (MPAI)

manually coded artificial intelligence (MCAI)

Firstly, We would like to distinguish hard artificial intelligence (HAI) from soft artificial intelligence (SAI), where:

- Soft artificial intelligence (SAI) refers to artificial intelligence code in computer systems manually written by human programmers.

- Hard artificial intelligence (refers) to artificial intelligence code in computer systems created using metaprogramming techniques, not fully written by human programmers directly.

Although some readers may find our nomenclature bewildering, we hope they become clear as we describe our models.

Most of the artificial intelligence code that we employ today in computer systems are MCAI. Theoretically, it is impossible for MCAI to become AHLAI. 

Nevertheless, FHLAI and MPAI become relevant in outer space exploration and simulation or in environments inaccessible to human beings, such as underground or undersea. As online gaming grows to be a trillion dollars industry, it becomes commercially viable if a fraction of the resources can be diverted to simulation of inhabitable environments (SIMIE). 

We attempt to develop the model of AHLAI in order to expose the absurdity of TS. In nature and human societies, the notion of adversary or enemies arise due to competition for resources amongst individual persons or animals (entities headcount). There could be the following types of AHLAI:

Scenario I - AHLAI replaces human labour, causing unemployment.

Scenario II - AHLAI capable of making independent decision to attack or murder human beings. 

Scenario I is nothing new. Just a new type of Marxist class struggle, where human beings are the main protagonists and AHLAI being accessories.

MCAI will continue to grow as MPAI needs more proof to attract investments. 


AHLAI is excuse for evil legislation?

Model this with HGT.


Compare bubble sort to map search?

Can AI beat human in business values?

Code written by human programmers make most of money.

Will self code ever reach significant ratio?

Unlikely. Only in space exploration?

Simulate AI space exploration?

Turn focus of Phos contribution from AI to simplifying software engineering, especially on Datong Token and social networks. 

All functions that human programmers write are used as components of programs. HGM makes them searchable hence enables automatic composition. No similar mechanisms exist previously.

Whatever primitive functions, mathematical equations, they are made by their authors. Someone else just reuse them. Recreating them requires intelligence, but has no novel values. Reusing them has additional values. HGM provides the universal model to do so, including delegation. 

This model is supported by all human beings learning and decision making experience.

Reuse and delegation. 

Advocates of AI may not appreciate the values of primitive functions created by human programmers and mathematicians?

Human collective intelligence. Alone cannot do much. HGM can model collective intelligence. 


An uneducated human dish washer may have special talents in gambling or stock market.

Collective, not individual achievements or human civilization.
