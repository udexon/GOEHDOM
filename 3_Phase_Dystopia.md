### Three Phases towards a Robotic Dystopia

We have just entered the first decade of zero advantage from population growth, marked by the rise of Huawei and DJI, world largest makers of Android mobile devices and network equipment, and commercial unmanned aerial vehicles. So even academics have not time to conceive theories on the age of diminishing population returns. 

Urbanization drives population away from rural areas. Mines and farms and fishery becomes completely robotics. Police too. 

Populous cities first. Depopulate developing countries, by slow death low birth, or war. China India Europe America. Japan inhabitable due to disasters and Chinese migration. 

Bourgeois control robots. Proletariat live by manual labor. Bourgeois kill proletariat by war or controlled genocide, to get land, mines, resources on land and sea. 

Finally, proletariat human are extinguished. Then bourgeois human and robot class war begin , after they invent human robot religions, for ease of motivating and mobilization. 

Population growth is only advantageous before Android and DJI drone, for military strength and economic development.
