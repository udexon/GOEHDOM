[Phos multitiered stack machine](http://5gl.epizy.com/nsm/Phos.html) demonstrates the viability of implementing a shell to execute Phos commands within any known host programming language.

By definition, we do not know how much homoiconic code will be needed to achieve human level artificial intelligence. However, through trials, when we have 100 or 1000 Phos code example, we may begin to find a pattern, just like any scientific experiment. 

Time from now to Technological singularity, time to build 100k Phos function for self question answering?

Concepts need to be built based on code. eg. pointers. Same with stack machine. 

Homoiconicity refers to ....

Derivative homoiconicity ....

#### Learning Curve

#### Benefits of Learning Phos

:: Needs to elaborate as it is a new language. Use this as tutorial and marketing piece.

One may wonder what the benefits of learning Phos are, compared to the at least a dozen of well publicized and well documented new programming languages, supported by huge corporations? 

Graph theory, fundamental of programming, mathematics, unification of programming and mathematics.

3 most important reasons first, others later:

- fundamental of graph and stack machine programming
- Forth can provide the above, but no ecosystem to learn, hence Phos let programmers to create own ecosystem compatible with existing habits, from JavaScript to Android NDK. Cite examples.
- to understand the concepts and motivations proposed in this project.
Phos does not conflict with other ecosystems, but is the glue to integrate all ecosystems.

:: Must write to motivate others as pioneers. This is the reality I must face. Then only will readers trust me.

Say I will be happy to recruit 5 collaborators.
