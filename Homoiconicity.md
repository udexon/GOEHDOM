#### Homoiconic Transformation

Homoiconic transformation: transform non homoiconic code into homoiconic form. 

:: Focus on this as theoretical basis of code transformation to convince readers. 

Theoretical issues can be addressed using homoiconic code build up itself!!

Homoiconic transformation = Shunting Yard Algorithm + Inverse

https://github.com/udexon/ISYA/blob/master/README.md

An RPN operator is homoiconic as it can become an operand of another RPN operator.

While there has been no ?? mathematical model on homoiconic transformation, HT intrinsically by definition can bootstrap its own mathematical model. Use homoiconic code to build mathematical model to analyze homoiconic code.

#### Main Contribution

As we are able to represent all known code in RPN, we may attempt to build a hierarchy of code, starting from the most primitive assignment operation to the most complex numerical functions. 
We will be able to construct functions that compose functions using primitive functions, based on the homoiconic properties of RPN.

#### Human level artificial intelligence is type III graph search (GS3)

Homoiconic Graph Search as Model of Human Level Artificial Intelligence

(HGS)

Homoiconic Graph Machine HGM??

:: Emphasize word "graph"

Our conjecture: Human level artificial intelligence is type III search.

Type I search: simple look up.

Type II search: predefined functions, map, inverse kinematics, chess.

Type III search: homoiconic composite functions

Now it is possible to compare and analyze function composition in Phos vs. other programming languages. Previously not possible. This is one of the most crucial benefits of Phos.

Discuss simple tree to type III search.

Patent did not mention RPN!!

[Phos multitiered stack machine](http://5gl.epizy.com/nsm/Phos.html) demonstrates the viability of implementing a shell to execute Phos commands within any known host programming language.

By definition, we do not know how much homoiconic code will be needed to achieve human level artificial intelligence. However, through trials, when we have 100 or 1000 Phos code example, we may begin to find a pattern, just like any scientific experiment. 

Time from now to Technological singularity, time to build 100k Phos function for self question answering?

Concepts need to be built based on code. eg. pointers. Same with stack machine. 

Homoiconicity refers to ....

Derivative homoiconicity ....

Universal Derivative Homoiconicity ....

#### Learning Curve

#### Benefits of Learning Phos

:: Needs to elaborate as it is a new language. Use this as tutorial and marketing piece.

One may wonder what the benefits of learning Phos are, compared to the at least a dozen of well publicized and well documented new programming languages, supported by huge corporations? 

Graph theory, fundamental of programming, mathematics, unification of programming and mathematics.

3 most important reasons first, others later:

- fundamental of graph and stack machine programming
- Forth can provide the above, but no ecosystem to learn, hence Phos let programmers to create own ecosystem compatible with existing habits, from JavaScript to Android NDK. Cite examples.
- to understand the concepts and motivations proposed in this project.
Phos does not conflict with other ecosystems, but is the glue to integrate all ecosystems.

:: Must write to motivate others as pioneers. This is the reality I must face. Then only will readers trust me.

Say I will be happy to recruit 5 collaborators.
