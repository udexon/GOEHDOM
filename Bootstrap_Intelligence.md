### Bootstrapping Machine Intelligence

We propose a bootstrap mechanism for machine intelligence, where fundamental data structures and operations are represented in reverse Polish notation and evaluated by a virtual machine, and its results in turn assessed by a human programmer. 

By "machine intelligence", we refer to the  low level aspects of artificial intelligence such as arithmetic, image processing and chess playing, specifically the algorithms that have been implemented as code of a programming language. We reserve the term "artificial intelligence" to a more general category of computation, including those theories which have yet to be implemented as computer program.
